## üéØ Introduction to Flux CD

**Flux CD** is a tool for **GitOps** that continuously **reconciles the state of your Kubernetes cluster** with the desired state declared in a **Git repository**. Essentially, Flux makes your **Git repository the source of truth** for your infrastructure and applications. 

It automates the process of applying the desired state from your Git repository into your Kubernetes cluster. If there are differences between what‚Äôs running in your cluster and what‚Äôs declared in Git, Flux will reconcile these differences to bring the cluster back to the desired state.

---

## ü§î Why Flux?

Flux CD provides a **GitOps** solution with the following key benefits:

- **Declarative management**: Define the desired state of your applications and infrastructure in Git, and let Flux apply and enforce that state.
- **Automated synchronization**: Flux continuously monitors your Git repository for changes and applies them to your cluster automatically.
- **Rollback & auditing**: Since every change is versioned in Git, you can easily track changes and roll back if needed.
- **Kubernetes-native**: Flux is designed to work seamlessly with Kubernetes and integrates with popular tools like **Helm**, **Kustomize**, and more.

---

## üîÑ How Does Flux Work?

Flux operates by watching your Git repository for changes. It installs **controllers** in your Kubernetes cluster, which continuously monitor the repository and ensure that the cluster reflects the desired state defined in Git.

Here‚Äôs the high-level process:

1. **Git as the Source of Truth**: You define your Kubernetes manifests (like Deployments, Services, HelmReleases, etc.) in a Git repository.
2. **Flux Controllers**: Flux deploys various controllers (like the **helm-controller**, **kustomize-controller**, etc.) into your cluster.
3. **Continuous Reconciliation**: Flux regularly polls the Git repository for changes and applies any updates to the Kubernetes cluster.
4. **Self-healing**: If someone manually changes the cluster state (e.g., deletes a pod), Flux will notice the drift and revert the cluster back to the state defined in Git.

---

## üîÅ Flux Workflow and Lifecycle

1. **Bootstrap**: The process starts with the `flux bootstrap` command, which installs the Flux controllers and sets up the connection between your Git repository and the Kubernetes cluster.
2. **GitOps Sync**: After bootstrap, Flux monitors your Git repository. Every time you push a change to the repository (like adding a HelmRelease), Flux pulls that change and applies it to the cluster.
3. **Reconciliation**: Flux periodically checks the state of the cluster. If the cluster state doesn‚Äôt match the repository state, Flux reconciles the differences by reapplying the desired state.
4. **Lifecycle Management**: From installation, configuration, and updates to automated rollbacks, Flux takes care of the entire lifecycle of your Kubernetes resources.

## üì¶ Demo Setup: Deploy Nginx using Helm and Flux

This demo will showcase how to deploy an **Nginx** server using **Helm** with Flux CD on a **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** cluster.

### Step 1: Install Flux using `flux bootstrap`

The `flux bootstrap` command is used to install Flux CD into your cluster and set up the GitOps connection.

1. **Run the following command** to bootstrap Flux:

    ```bash
    flux bootstrap github \
      --owner=<your-github-username> \
      --repository=<your-repo-name> \
      --branch=main \
      --path=./clusters/gke-cluster \
      --personal
    ```

    This command:
    - **Installs Flux CD** in your Kubernetes cluster.
    - **Configures GitHub integration** by linking your repository with the cluster.
    - **Sets up Flux controllers** in the `flux-system` namespace to monitor changes.

### Step 2: Configure a Helm Repository

To deploy Nginx using Helm, we need to set up a **HelmRepository** resource that points to the Bitnami Helm charts.

1. **Create `helm-repo.yaml`** with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
    kind: HelmRepository
    metadata:
      name: stable-charts
      namespace: flux-system
    spec:
      interval: 1h
      url: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    ```

2. **Add, commit, and push the file** to your GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git add ./clusters/gke-cluster/helm-repo.yaml
    git commit -m "Add Bitnami Helm repository"
    git push origin main
    ```

3. **Reconcile Flux** to apply the Helm repository:

    ```bash
    flux reconcile source helm stable-charts -n flux-system
    ```

### Step 3: Deploy Nginx with HelmRelease

1. **Create `nginx-helmrelease.yaml`** to deploy Nginx:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
    kind: HelmRelease
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      namespace: default
    spec:
      releaseName: nginx
      chart:
        spec:
          chart: nginx
          version: "18.2.2"  # The latest Nginx version
          sourceRef:
            kind: HelmRepository
            name: stable-charts
            namespace: flux-system
      interval: 5m
      values:
        service:
          type: LoadBalancer
    ```

2. **Add, commit, and push the HelmRelease** to your repository:

    ```bash
    git add ./clusters/gke-cluster/nginx-helmrelease.yaml
    git commit -m "Deploy Nginx with HelmRelease"
    git push origin main
    ```

3. **Reconcile Flux** to deploy Nginx:

    ```bash
    flux reconcile kustomization flux-system -n flux-system
    ```

### Step 4: Verify the Deployment

1. **Check the status of the HelmRelease**:

    ```bash
    flux get helmreleases -n default
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    NAME    REVISION        SUSPENDED       READY   MESSAGE
    nginx   18.2.2          False           True    Helm install succeeded
    ```

2. **Check the Nginx service**:

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n default
    ```

    Look for an **EXTERNAL-IP** under the `nginx` service.

3. **Access Nginx**:

    Visit the external IP in your browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **HelmRelease Not Ready**: If the HelmRelease shows a status of `Not Ready`, check the following:
  - Ensure the Helm chart URL is correct and accessible.
  - Verify that the configuration values are valid.
  - Check the logs of the `helm-controller` for errors.

- **GitRepository Status Issues**: If the GitRepository is not ready:
  - Check if the secret used for Git access is configured correctly.
  - Ensure that the Git URL is correct and that you have permission to access it.

- **Pods Not Running**: If the Nginx pod is not running:
  - Describe the pod to check for events indicating why it failed to start.
  - Verify that the deployment configuration is correct.

### Do's and Don'ts

#### Do's:
- **Use Version Control**: Always commit your changes to the Git repository and use meaningful commit messages.
- **Test Changes in a Staging Environment**: Before applying changes to production, test them in a staging environment.
- **Monitor Flux Logs**: Regularly check Flux controller logs for warnings or errors.

#### Don'ts:
- **Avoid Manual Changes in Kubernetes**: Changes should only be made via Git to maintain the GitOps workflow.
- **Don't Ignore Warnings**: If Flux or Kubernetes raises warnings, investigate them promptly.
- **Don't Use Hardcoded Values**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information; instead,

 use Kubernetes secrets.

### Best Practices
- **Use Kustomize for Environment-Specific Configurations**: If you have multiple environments (dev, staging, prod), consider using Kustomize to manage environment-specific configurations.
- **Set Appropriate Reconciliation Intervals**: Configure reconciliation intervals that make sense for your application and workload.
- **Maintain Clear Documentation**: Keep your README and other documentation up-to-date with your deployment process and configurations.

## üîó How Does Flux Interact with Git?

When you run commands like `flux reconcile`, Flux **does not check local files**. Instead, it pulls the latest configuration from the **GitHub repository**. Here‚Äôs what happens:

1. **Flux controllers** in the Kubernetes cluster regularly check the Git repository for updates.
2. When you push a change (like updating a HelmRelease), Flux detects that change by monitoring the Git repository.
3. Running `flux reconcile` manually triggers Flux to check the Git repository immediately and apply any changes found there.

In summary, Flux ensures that the **state defined in Git** is applied to the Kubernetes cluster.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands to Manage Flux

Here are some key commands for managing your Flux setup:

- **Reconcile Flux components**:
    ```bash
    flux reconcile kustomization flux-system -n flux-system
    ```

- **Get the status of all Helm releases**:
    ```bash
    flux get helmreleases -n default
    ```

- **View HelmRelease events**:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe helmrelease nginx -n default
    ```

- **Check service status**:
    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n default
    ```

### üìù Conclusion

With Flux CD and GitOps, managing Kubernetes deployments becomes simple, reliable, and version-controlled. All changes are made in Git, and Flux ensures that your cluster is always in sync with the desired state declared in the repository.
